# Animal 

The task is to create an application using `HTML` , `JS` , `CSS` which basically renders the photos of animals given below with the urls in the given order.

**Note** : for the image rendering `url` use the url **https://www2.d125.org/applied_arts/teched/courses/WEB/portfolios/2014_FallP8/Rami_Portfolio_Period8/unit4_css/project_1folder/cssProject1/`{Animal.jpg}`**
where `Animal.jpg` means the name of the animal.
 
 for **eg.** if we want the image for a `camel` it would be:
`https://www2.d125.org/applied_arts/teched/courses/WEB/portfolios/2014_FallP8/Rami_Portfolio_Period8/unit4_css/project_1folder/cssProject1/camel.jpg`

similarly we can obtain the images of the animals given and use it in our web page in the same order to render the page like.
